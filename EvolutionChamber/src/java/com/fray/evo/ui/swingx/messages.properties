welcome=Hello! Welcome to the Evolution Chamber\n\
		To start, enter in some units you would like to have.\n\
		When you have decided what you would like, hit Start.\n\
		\n\
		Please report any issues or new features you would like at:\n\
		http://code.google.com/p/evolutionchamber/issues/list\n\
		\n\
		How to use:\n\
		Enter in what you would like to see as your end state. Hit Go. Be patient.\n\
		The build order will compute, and it can take several minutes to potentially hours.\n\
		All build orders are saved and may be viewed later.\n\
		\n\
		Remember that this is evolutionary science, so don't be surprised if things seem wonky!\n\
		Also note that evolution can be a slow process, so expect new developments even after\n\
		hours of running the program, even on relatively simple build orders.\n\
		\n\
		How to use waypoints:\n\
		To use waypoints, enter first what you would like at the end of the build.\n\
		Then go to a waypoint slot, enter a deadline time, and units.\n\
		All the waypoints are cumulative, so if you enter 6 zergling@3:00 on WP1,\n\
		7 roach@6:00 on WP2, and 6 muta on final, you will end up with 6 lings,\n\
		7 roaches, and 6 mutas by the time it finds a valid build.\n\
